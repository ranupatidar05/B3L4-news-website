        <h1 id="r1">The Forest Conservation Amendment Bill 2023 is expected to be tabled in the Parliament's Monsoon session. Key provisions of the bill have come under fire</h1>
        <img src="./img/1.png">
        <p>One of the proposed clauses in the bill exempts prior clearance for strategic developmental projects of national importance on forest land situated within 100 km of international borders, which will include ecologically fragile regions of Himalayas that are home to a variety of endemic wildlife like the red panda(Parveen Kaswan)</p>
        <p>The Forest Conservation Amendment Bill 2023 which was introduced in Lok Sabha in March has attracted attention from various quarters after a joint panel headed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Rajendra Agarwal invited public suggestions in May. Earlier this week, around 400 ecologists, scientists and naturalists wrote to Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav and other members of the Parliament urging them not to table the bill in the monsoon session which begins on July 20.</p>

        <img src="./img/2.png">
        <p>G20 ministerial meetings on clean energy, energy transition, the environment, and climate sustainability this month in Goa and Chennai are expected to set the tone for the Intergovernmental forum’s approach ahead of the UN Climate Meeting (COP28) in Dubai in November. The forum’s member countries are responsible for 80% of global emissions.</p>
        <p>The rich and emerging economies such as the United States (US), China, and India, which are part of the forum, along with the European Union (EU) have varied environmental priorities based on their status and historical contribution to emissions.</p>
        <p>The clean energy ministerial is scheduled in Goa on July 21 and 22. The two-day energy transitions meeting will conclude on July 20. The environment and climate sustainability ministers will meet on July 28 in Chennai.</p>
        <p>Increasing renewable energy goals, phasing down fossil fuels, and the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming under 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels are among the main issues that will be deliberated.</p>
